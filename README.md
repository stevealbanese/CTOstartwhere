# CTOstartwhere
Taking an IT management role in a new company ? Dont know where to start ? Then, you're welcome.


Disclaimer :
In reality, and condescension aside (don't misunderstand me). I found myself in a role of responsibility where I had to manage all the IT equipment, licences, softwares, troubleshooting etc. Sometimes you're blessed and everything runs smoothly, everything is already up and running, but sometimes there's nothing and you start from scratch.

**If you fall into the 2nd category then you can continue reading.**


## What, Where, Who, When, Why ?

The basic questions that really get you started and enable you to take stock of the situation.


## Inventory is all.
I know this phrase sucks. But hear me out.

Make an inventory of everything that's physical... screen, CPU, mouse, keyboard, servers, printers, etc. everything. The advantage is that you don't actually have to do it yourself, you can delegate or ask certain users if their level allows it.

**Here is the information you need to gather :**
1. Brand.
2. Model.
3. Serial Number.
4. Date of purchase.
5. End of warranty date.
6. User.
7. Previous user.
8. Where can I find it. Where in the open space ? In which office ? Be specific so you dont waste your time searching for a switch hidden behind a printer.
9. etc.


## What about softwares ?
Same. inventory is all.

1. list of all softwares, Free and open source, Freemium, etc.
2. Licence.
3. Name.
4. Date of purchase.
5. End of subscription.
6. Who purchased it and with which e-mail address ? Important to know if the person leave the company and the licence is bound to a specific address.

Make a dashboard to follow the subscriptions you have. A SharePoint list will do perfectly.
In your list, add the link to website, you'll save time.


WAIT A MINUTE. You think it was that easy ? No, what about the credentials you used for that subscription ? Yes... you need to document that also. Because your CTO leaves. What about the email address he used to log and subscribed. You lost it all. So document it.

## Passowrd manager
Two words : **password. manager.**
Everyone, and everything must be in a password manager. You're not clever saving your logs in an excel files. You do not have redondancy, you do not have contingency plans. It is their job.
I recommend :
1. 1password.
2. ProtonPass.
3. Bitwarden (open source).
It will also help you make quick offboarding process through the admin tool.

# Infrastructure Documentation

So, now we have the lists of :
1. All the hardwares
2. All the softares

To those, we will add the users access.
Who can log where and with what level of access ?
- any superadmin out there that shouldn't be ?
- Old employee access ?
